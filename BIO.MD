# About Me

Hi, I am currently learning about **DevOps** and expanding my skills in various tools and technologies. Below is a summary of the areas I am focusing on and the progress I've made so far:

## Skills and Tools I'm Learning

- **GitHub**: Understanding repositories, version control, and collaboration using pull requests and branching.
- **Ubuntu**: Exploring the Linux environment, managing files, and using system commands effectively.
- **Terminal Commands**: Mastering navigation, file manipulation, and process management in the terminal.
- **Markdown**: Writing structured and readable documentation.

## Progress Highlights

- Set up my first **GitHub repository** and learned to push, pull, and merge changes.
- Installed and configured **Ubuntu** on a virtual machine for practice.
- Practiced essential terminal commands such as `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, and `chmod`.
- Wrote my first `.md` file using **Markdown syntax** to document my learning journey.

## Next Steps

- Dive deeper into **CI/CD pipelines** using tools like Jenkins.
- Learn about containerization with **Docker** and orchestration with **Kubernetes**.
- Automate tasks with **Bash scripting**.

## Fun Fact

I love breaking down complex problems into smaller tasks and solving them step by step, which makes DevOps a perfect field for me to explore!
